# IEEE 802.1X Overview

Devices attempting to connect to a LAN or WLAN require an authentication mechanism. IEEE 802.1X, an IEEE Standard for Port-Based Network Access Control (PNAC), provides protected authentication for secure network access. An 802.1X network differs from home networks in one major way; it includes an authentication server called a RADIUS Server, which checks a user's credentials to see if they are an active member of the organization and grants users varying levels of access to the network based on network policies. This setup allows unique credentials or certificates to be used per user, eliminating the reliance on a single network password that can be easily stolen.

## Key Takeaways

- **802.1X** is an authentication protocol that grants access to networks via a RADIUS server.
- **802.1X and RADIUS** based security is considered the gold standard for securing wireless and wired networks today.

## How Does 802.1X Work?

802.1X is a network authentication protocol that opens ports for network access when an organization authenticates a user's identity and authorizes them for access to the network. The user's identity is determined based on their credentials or certificate, which is confirmed by the RADIUS server. The RADIUS server communicates with the organization's directory, typically over the LDAP or SAML protocol.

### Key Takeaways

- **802.1X** gives the device access to the protected side of the network after authentication.
- **802.1X** offers various authentication methods such as username/password, certificates, OTP, etc.

## What is 802.1X EAP Security?

The standard authentication protocol used on encrypted networks is Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), which provides a secure method to send identifying information over-the-air for network authentication. 802.1X is the standard used for passing EAP over wired and wireless Local Area Networks (LAN). It provides an encrypted EAP tunnel that prevents outside users from intercepting information.

The EAP protocol can be configured for credential (EAP-TTLS/PAP and PEAP-MSCHAPv2) and digital certificate (EAP-TLS) authentication, making it a highly secure method for protecting the authentication process.

### Key Takeaways

- **EAP** is the tunnel that transfers a user’s identifying information from client to server.
- **EAP tunnels** most often use username/password or certificates.
- Not all EAP tunnels are created equally; man-in-the-middle attacks are easier to perform with username/password.

## What is 802.1X Used For?

802.1X is used for secure network authentication. Organizations dealing with valuable and sensitive information need a secure method of transporting data. 802.1X is used so devices can communicate securely with access points (enterprise-grade routers). It was historically used by large organizations like enterprises, universities, and hospitals but is rapidly being adopted by smaller businesses due to growing cyber security threats.

### Key Takeaways

- **802.1X** secures connections to wired and wireless networks via rotating key security and avoiding Open/Unencrypted or static key (PSK) connections.
- **802.1X** is used in corporate and campus settings where users get authorized or removed from network access as they enter and leave the organization.

## Are IEEE 802.1X and Wi-Fi the Same?

Almost. The IEEE 802.1X standard was first designed for use in wired Ethernet networks. Wi-Fi refers to the IEEE 802.11x standard specifically – a modified version of the original standard.

Most security and networking professionals use the term 802.1X for both wired and wireless networks if they are using WPA2-Enterprise security.

## 802.1X vs WPA2-Enterprise: What's the Difference?

802.1X is an IEEE standard framework for encrypting and authenticating a user trying to associate with a wired or wireless network. WPA-Enterprise uses TKIP with RC4 encryption, while WPA2-Enterprise adds AES encryption.

## What is Wired 802.1X?

Authenticating a wired network connection for 802.1X is similar to wireless. The wired network user must connect to the secure network from their device and present a signed certificate or valid credentials to authenticate their identity.

The primary difference is that instead of establishing a secure connection with a wireless switch, your device must be Ethernet connected and authenticate to an 802.1X-capable switch. The device and RADIUS server establish trust over the wired connection, and if the user is recognized, they will be authorized for secure network use.

## How Secure is 802.1X?

When used correctly, it is the gold standard of network authentication security. It can prevent over-the-air credential theft attacks like Man-in-the-Middle attacks and Evil Twin proxies. It is much more secure than Pre-Shared Key networks, typically used in personal networks.

### Key Takeaways

- **802.1X** is one of the most secure protocols for network authentication, trumping WPA2/3-PSK and Open/Unencrypted connections.
- Requires precise configuration; mistakes made by users lead to security compromises.
- Digital certificates instead of username/password-based 802.1X mitigate security issues.

## Is 802.1X Encrypted?

Yes, 802.1X is encrypted.

802.1X WPA is generally reserved for personal networks, such as home Wi-Fi, and runs on RC4-based TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol) encryption. It's less secure than WPA2 but usually sufficient for home use.

802.1X WPA2 generally chooses AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), which is the most secure standard available. It is a bit more difficult and costly to set up, so it's used in higher-stake environments like businesses.

## The Components of 802.1X

There are a few components needed to make 802.1X work. If you already have access points and some spare server space, you possess all the hardware needed to make secure wireless happen. Sometimes you don't even need the server; some access points come with built-in software that can operate 802.1X (though only for the smallest of small deployments).

### Key Takeaways

- **802.1X** includes four major components: client, access point/switch, RADIUS server, and identity provider.

### Client / Supplicant

A device participating in the 802.1X authentication must have a piece of software called a supplicant installed in the network stack. The supplicant will participate in the initial negotiation of the EAP transaction with the switch or controller and package up the user's credentials in a manner compliant with 802.1X.

### Key Takeaways

- Software on the device contains the configuration and connection data (certificates/credentials) sent to the access point/switch.
- Requires precise setup to avoid credential theft if username/password authentication is used. Consider configuration software or switching to certificate-based authentication.
- Most OSs have supported 802.1X for the past 10-15 years; IoT support is catching up.

### Switch / Access Point / Controller

The switch or wireless controller acts as a 'broker' in the 802.1X communication between the client and the switch. It initiates the exchange by sending an EAPOL-Start packet to the client when the client connects to the network.

### Key Takeaways

- These devices facilitate communication between the device and the RADIUS server.
- The access point/switch is where you configure the network to use 802.1X instead of Open/Unencrypted or WPA2/3-PSK.
- They act as enforcement points when RADIUS servers return precise access control policy.

### RADIUS Server

The RADIUS server acts as the “security guard” of the network; as users connect to the network, the RADIUS authenticates their identity and authorizes them for network use. 

### Key Takeaways

- RADIUS Servers are the decision points for devices requesting access to the protected side of the network.
- RADIUS Servers interact with identity providers to authenticate, authorize, and report connections.

## Why Does 802.1X Need a RADIUS Server?

802.1X needs a RADIUS server because there needs to be a dedicated server to verify credentials. The authentication facet of 802.1X actually occurs at the RADIUS server.

### Identity Store / Directory

The Identity Store refers to the entity in which usernames and passwords are stored. In most cases, this is Active Directory or an LDAP server. Almost any RADIUS server can connect to your AD or LDAP to validate users.

### Key Takeaways

- **802.1X** traditionally requires a directory (on-prem or cloud) so the RADIUS can communicate to identify each user and their access level.
- Directories use usernames/passwords, making them vulnerable to major security issues.
- Newer cloud identity providers (Azure AD/Entra ID, Okta, Google) can interact with next-gen RADIUS to perform passwordless identity authorization.

## How Does 802.1X Authentication Work?

The 802.1X authentication process is comprised of four steps: Initialization, Initiation, Negotiation, and Authentication.

1. **Initialization**
    - The authenticator detects a new device and attempts to establish a connection. The authenticator port is set to an “unauthorized” state, meaning only 802.1X traffic will be accepted and every other connection will be dropped.
2. **Initiation**
    - The authenticator starts transmitting EAP-Requests to the new device, which sends EAP responses back to the authenticator. The response usually contains a way to identify the new device. The authenticator receives the EAP response and relays it to the authentication server in a RADIUS access request packet.
3. **Negotiation**
    - The authentication server responds with a RADIUS access challenge packet containing the approved EAP authentication method for the device. The authenticator passes the challenge packet to the device to be

 answered. The authentication server may exchange multiple authentication messages with the device and the authenticator.
4. **Authentication**
    - The device responds to the server and RADIUS responds with a success or fail message to the authenticator. The port changes to an “authorized” state and the device is granted access to the network.
